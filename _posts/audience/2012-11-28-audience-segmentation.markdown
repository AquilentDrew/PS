<p>Research conducted by CMS has identified the most likely users of the Marketplace and categorized them based on their life situation, common concerns, and biggest challenges to purchasing health insurance. While the users come from various backgrounds, life situations, and age groups, the research demonstrates that they share a handful of primary questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the health care law affect me?</li>
<li>What am I eligible for?</li>
<li>What do I have to do?</li>
<li>How can I get help?</li>
</ul>
<p>A driving principle of healthcare.gov is to identify the information users need and provide it as quickly and plainly as possible. We have therefore placed these questions very prominently on the home page and link to plain, clear answers.</p>
<p>CMS research has identified three psychographic groups that account for more than 90 percent of our target audience<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. [See</span><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"></span>Healthcare.gov will therefore focus on attracting and meeting the needs of these groups. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy and Young: 47.8% of nonelderly uninsured adults</li>
<li>Sick, Active and Worried: 28.9% of the uninsured</li>
<li>Passive and Skeptical: 15.3% of the uninsured</li>
</ul>
