<p>Our primary target is uninsured American consumers who are looking to buy health insurance through the Marketplace (or their families, friends, and assisters).</p>
<p>Of the 308.8 million American citizens:</p>
<ul>
<li>48.6 million are uninsured</li>
<li>Of the uninsured, 26.5% (22.5 million) are between the ages of 45-64</li>
<li>25.4% (12.3 million) are under 19 years of age</li>
<li>31% have household incomes less than $25,000</li>
<li>Of the total uninsured, 17% are Spanish-speakers</li>
</ul>
<p>We expect tens of millions of Americans to enroll through the Marketplace.</p>
<p>A secondary consumer audience are those who have insurance and are looking to understand their options under the Affordable Care Act. As more Americans become insured through the Marketplace, we expect our audience and emphasis to shift somewhat to this group. But healthcare.gov’s Marketplace section must remain the highest priority, since new people become eligible during the year, enrollees’ status changes, and people begin to prepare for re-enrollment in October of 2014</p>
<p><b>Audience 2: Small Businesses.</b> A secondary audience of healthcare.gov are the operators of millions of America’s small businesses. Some offer insurance, some don’t. Both groups will face new opportunities as the SHOP program goes online in October.</p>
<p>The questions small business owners have surrounding health insurance differ significantly from the uninsured looking to buy health insurance. As such, healthcare.gov includes a section of the site that specifically addresses their needs. It provides them with answers on how they can get assistance through SHOP. The Learn home page has a prominent prompt that helps small business owners quickly get to their section of the site</p>
<p><b>Audience 3: Non-consumers. </b>We recognize that there will be a smaller subset of our audience who are not consumers. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media</li>
<li>States</li>
<li>Legislators</li>
<li>Non-Profits / Religious Organizations</li>
<li>Assistors / Navigators / CSRs</li>
<li>Researchers</li>
<li>Developers looking to use our API</li>
</ul>
<p>While these users can easily navigate the site to gather the information they need, their needs should <strong>never</strong> outweigh those of our primary audience. To reiterate: <i>healthcare.gov is a consumer site. Everything else takes a back seat or gets no seat at all. </i></p>
<p>See our <a href="/" title="Home"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Functional Footer</span></a> strategy for how we serve these users.</p>
