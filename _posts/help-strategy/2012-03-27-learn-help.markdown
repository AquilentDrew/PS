<p>The Learn side of healthcare.gov is a repository of information aimed at helping the user understand the health care law, apply for health insurance, and the considerations influencing their decisions. With its Q&amp;A format, curated and dynamic links to related content, and deep, user-focused content resources, the site itself is essentially one big help app.</p>
<p>There is, however, a Help Support Center that consolidates all Learn help resources. On this page is a collection of links to:<b><b><br>
</b></b></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">content that answers top user questions (dynamic, based on metrics)</li>
<li dir="ltr">a link to the glossary (with a sublist of top items, dynamically generated)</li>
<li dir="ltr">state Marketplace sites via dropdown menu</li>
<li dir="ltr">information about finding Navigators, assisters, and help in your community</li>
<li dir="ltr">a note explaining that when you are in the application you can get phone and chat help (without providing the number or link here)</li>
<li dir="ltr">email sign-up form to receive regular updates about key features and important dates</li>
</ul>
<p>The Help Center is a link from the functional footer. Links to it appear around the site when metrics show user confusion.</p>
<p>We do not use “definition” tooltips on the Learn side. Our experience with healthcare.gov 1.0 showed this created considerable usability problems.</p>
<p>Feedback from the VOC tool, metrics, social media and the CSRs, navigators, and assisters is used to identify additional help content that needs to be created.<b id="internal-source-marker_0.41973185958340764"> </b></p>
