<p>If users need help while filling out their application in the Marketplace, help is available in several ways. We do not take users out of the Marketplace application in order to get help&ndash;we bring the help to them in the application. This reduces user anxiety about losing their saved information or simply losing their place. Our approach:</p>
<p><b id="internal-source-marker_0.41973185958340764">A context-sensitive <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Help Drawer</span>, which opens when a user clicks on the “?” icon on the right side of the page.</b></p>
<p><a href="../../images/Application___Help__snack-e1359495086629.jpg"><img width="949" height="1611" src="../../images/Application___Help__snack-e1359495086629.jpg" alt="Application___Help__snack" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1280"></a></p>
<p>It contains and provides consistent, easy access to:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">An explanation of the entire card the visitor is completing&ndash;what is being asked for and why.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Phone support (800 number for the call center)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Access to the LiveChat functionality</li>
<li dir="ltr">Information on how to get in touch with a Navigator or local assister.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>On first visit, the Drawer opens automatically, displaying a quick introduction and short tutorial on using the app, with options for the user to skip and view later. The help Drawer remembers the last user state&ndash;the most recently used help Drawer is open when the user returns.</p>
<p><b id="internal-source-marker_0.41973185958340764">Glossary terms </b>are used if a word or phrase is unique to health insurance and requires definition. A tooltip appears just above the word or phrase.<b id="internal-source-marker_0.41973185958340764"> </b></p>
<p><b id="internal-source-marker_0.41973185958340764">Tooltips</b> are used to present bite-size information about questions or concepts that might need clarification.</p>
<p><b id="internal-source-marker_0.41973185958340764">Clickable</b> “Learn More” text is available for guidance that requires more than a bite but less than a meal. The information appears in the Drawer (or is highlighted if that content is already present).</p>
<p><a href="../../images/Application___Help__bites-e1359495276224.jpg"><img width="962" height="1662" src="../../images/Application___Help__bites-e1359495276224.jpg" alt="Application___Help__bites" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1279"></a></p>
<p><b id="internal-source-marker_0.41973185958340764">Bites, Snacks, and Meals.</b> If additional clarification is needed, the user can click on a link to access meal-sized content. Meal content is presented in a light box or in a more fully extended Help Drawer.<b id="internal-source-marker_0.41973185958340764"> </b></p>
<p>The content team enters customized explanatory content for each card. The content management system allows us to pull content from the Learn side of HC.gov (taking advantage of the sharable content concept). The CMS functionality allows us to pull a Bite into a tooltip, a Snack into the Help Drawer, or an entire Meal into the lightbox/extended Drawer as needed.</p>
