<p>Healthcare.gov has an integrated infographics strategy. By this we mean that as site content is developed, an infographics team member is included in the conversation to ensure that opportunities for graphic communication are identified and acted on.</p>
<h3>We use infographics for two important reasons:</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Infographics are very shareable on social media. Creating infographics that explain key ideas will ensure our message is shared widely on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, and other social platforms.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Infographics can simplify complex topics that would take many hundreds of words to explain. Our goals of brevity and serving low-literacy users are advanced by wise use of infographics.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Execution</h3>
<p>A distinctive healthcare.gov infographic style will be developed. This will ensure consistent branding, promote alignment with the site’s design, and prevent designers from “reinventing the wheel” with each assignment. This will allow for faster production.<br>
Infographics will follow standard healthcare.gov clearance process.</p>
<h3>Promotion</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Infographics will be tagged, called, and displayed around the site like any other content item.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">They will be embedded in all relevant Basic Pages.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">They will be shared aggressively on social media and featured on the blog and in Gov Delivery messages.</span></li>
</ul>
