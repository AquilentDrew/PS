<p>Video is an effective way to appeal to a low-literacy audience and users who may feel overwhelmed by the enormity and complexity of the Marketplace. Our video strategy will achieve the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Make complex information clear.</strong> Provide educational or informational content&ndash;via animation, whiteboard, scripted presentation, whatever approach fits&ndash;that helps explain the Marketplace and benefits of ACA.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Reach adults with literacy levels below 8th grade</strong> with information that can be understood without reading.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Develop Trust.</strong> Introduce a personal, emotional, humanized angle to the process of getting health insurance. Videos can provide engaging ways to connect viewers with people who are in similar situations, facing the same questions and challenges. This is a natural follow-on to the MyCare campaign.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Healthcare.gov videos should embrace the following practices:</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Under 2:00</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Consistent visual tone, so healthcare.gov Marketplace videos are instantly recognizable, whether animation, scripted, or other</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Must drive users to healthcare.gov/marketplace, as these videos will be widely circulated on social media</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Should be tested and iterated based on drop-off metric&ndash;video team must have time to do this</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Translation into Spanish, with diversity on screen an important factor across all videos</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Inverted pyramid style: Content of the video must be clear within 5 seconds</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>No separate video gallery.</h3>
<p>Our metrics demonstrate that the gallery gets little traffic. Further, the home page scroller attracts few views. Healthcare.gov videos will be presented in context, where and when they are useful. They appear on Topics pages and on search results pages. On the Connect &amp; Get Involved page, a single video will appear, with related videos appearing in a strip across the bottom (as we currently do on the healthcare.gov social hub). Icons on that page and the home page footer lead to the YouTube page, where all videos are in a single playlist.</p>
