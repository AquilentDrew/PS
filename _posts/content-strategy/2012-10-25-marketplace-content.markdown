<p>Marketplace content strategy should focus on three key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Pre-October landing page content<span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><br>
</span></span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">User-focused questionnaire</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Help content</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Because the Marketplace Application asks for very detailed and personal information, It is essential to establish and build usersâ€™ trust throughout the process. We ensure the language provides a clear explanation of what is being asked and why.</p>
<p>The content for the online application is derived from the Questionnaire developed by CCIIO which represents every possible item that may need to be asked for successful eligibility determinations during the application process.</p>
<p>The content team will integrate content to assist users as they move through the application process. The content team, working with the business leaders, will identify language to support users when they encounter information that is complex or new to someone purchasing health insurance for the first time. Key terms will link to the glossary.</p>
<p>When users may benefit from longer content items, content (bites/snacks and/or meals) from the Learn side will be loaded into the Help functionality on Marketplace. See related <a href="/help-strategy/marketplace-help/" title="Marketplace Help">Help Strategy</a>. By presenting this long content directly on the Marketplace pages, we reduce user anxiety that they could lose their work if they click into the Learn side.</p>
<p>The content in the Marketplace side follows the same standards for tone of voice, style, and brevity as the rest of the site.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info "><strong>Next Steps</strong><p></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">A dedicated content/business team should be tasked with walking through the application process from a user perspective to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Ensure that key concepts are well defined</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Provide explanations for why questions are asked</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Flag areas in need of additional help content</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Ensure that all benefits of the ACA are thoroughly explained when context requires it.</span></li>
</ul>
