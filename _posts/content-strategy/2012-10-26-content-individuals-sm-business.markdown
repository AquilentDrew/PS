<p>Both “Individuals &amp; Families” and “Small Businesses” have their own landing pages, which are linked to from the secondary navigation across the top of the site. They drive users to the most critical top-task content determined by metrics or business needs. These links are both hand-curated and dynamically generated.&nbsp;These will become among our highest-traffic pages so their successful performance is critical.</p>

<p>Each page consists of introductory text and either tiles, an image, or a video above the fold. A prominent link sends users to the Marketplace or SHOP.</p>
<p>Immediately below the fold are boxes with sets of links broken into three categories: Marketplace (hand curated), Most Popular (dynamically generated) and For You (based on user profile). Under Marketplace, the most prominent link is “Your State’s Marketplace.”</p>
<p>Small Businesses link collections are titled “If You Already Insure Your Employees,” “If You Do Not Currently Insure Your Employees,” and “If You’re Self-Employed.” All are hand-curated.</p>
