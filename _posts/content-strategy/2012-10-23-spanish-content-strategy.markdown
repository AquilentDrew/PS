<p>In order to accomplish our goals, we must engage 12 million uninsured Spanish speaking U.S. citizens. That’s nearly 20% of our target audience. Among U.S. Hispanic adults, 28% speak only Spanish, and 28% speak mostly Spanish. To reach this community, we recommend the following:</p>
<p><strong>Follow the principle of parity.</strong> We accept MotionPoint’s research-based conclusions that Spanish speakers expect to receive the same information as English speakers. We therefore recommend against creating a Spanish microsite. Based on MP’s reported unsuccessful experience replacing football images with soccer images on televisions for sale, we also recommend against having alternative images on the Spanish side. We will provide images that feature Hispanics, as well as other minorities, throughout healthcare.gov.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror the English site, as we currently do.</strong> We have already engaged CMS’s Spanish-language expert to improve our translation of healthcare.gov, and will continue to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Create a culturally aware Spanish-language outreach program.</strong> We feel the culturally aware communications need to occur off-site, when we engage in outreach activities. We therefore recommend that resources be committed to a separate Spanish-language outreach program that drives users to our mirror site. This is not a translation exercise. It’s a marketing challenge that requires a completely different, culturally aware approach. Since 53% of Hispanics use a mobile phone to access the web (compared to 33% of the general market), it’s critical that mobile be an integral part of this outreach strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Support outreach with separate Spanish-language landing pages.</strong> Campaigns may require landing pages with certain messaging, content related to certain outreach events, etc. We should be prepared to create these as orphan pages that then direct users to cuidadodesalud.gov.</p>
<p><strong>Leverage gobierno.usa.gov and its social media channels.</strong> The government’s largest Spanish-language website and channels have access to precisely the crowd we need to reach &mdash; Spanish speakers who use or need government services. The outreach team should develop a relationship with them early on.</p>
<p><strong>Minimize the number of content assets not translated.</strong> Given the number of Spanish-only speakers in our target audience it’s essential to translate most PDFs, videos, infographics, and other high-value assets. This has significant resource implications.</p>
<p><strong>Create Spanish-language Facebook, Twitter, and GovDelivery accounts.</strong> The data are compelling: 90% of Hispanics are on Facebook, 31% are on Twitter, and they are 21% more likely to engage in such activities as posting links, articles, videos, and web links than the U.S. social media population as a whole. We must leverage this. In the spirit of parity, Spanish speakers should receive nearly everything English speakers do on equivalent social channels. But to fully realize the potential of social media with Hispanics, we need to produce some dedicated, culturally aware&nbsp; Spanish-language content. This must be resourced as well.</p>
