<p>Healthcare.gov faces unique and urgent challenges in the area of search. On the one hand we have an enormous number of sites linking to ours and therefore substantial link equity. We are the undisputed search leader on the terms “Affordable Care Act,” “health care law,” and even “health insurance marketplace.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, we score terribly on such essential search terms going forward as “health insurance” or “get health coverage.” These terms are well-controlled by private companies and have been for years.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have Healthcare.gov appear within the top three search results whenever the most common terms surrounding the purchase of health insurance are queried. And we must continue to win “health insurance marketplace.” If we do not, others will control the story about the Marketplace.</p>
<p>Our external search strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Our new approach to structured content supports external search. Individual pieces of content, down to the chunk level, will be rich with keyword-laden metadata, which is crawled by search engines and used to rank search results.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Following our new taxonomy, which is based largely on the words people use when looking for health insurance information, will serve our SEO efforts well.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The fact that we will be publishing new content on Health Insurance Marketplaces regularly, and will be linked to from many credible sites, will help us build new link equity quickly.</li>
<li dir="ltr">We will integrate new Marketplace content into Google+. This will allow us to use spaces that we control to dominate search engines results pages.</li>
<li dir="ltr">We will follow best practices to leverage <a href="http://blog.ohmygov.com/blogs/general_news/archive/2013/01/23/how-government-can-use-graph-search-to-expand-on-facebook.aspx">Facebook’s powerful new Graph Search</a> functionality.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Because we will be creating so much content from scratch, we will be able to follow the most current best practices regarding keyword use, titles, URLs, links, and so on.</li>
</ul>
