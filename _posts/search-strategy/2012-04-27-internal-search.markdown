<p>Improving internal search is critical to high quality customer service, building user trust, serving Navigators, assisters, and CSRs, and the overall integrity of the brand. If users are frustrated, they will not trust us. If they cannot get answers from our site, they will go elsewhere&ndash;a worst-case outcome.</p>
<p>Healthcare.gov will use Google Enterprise Search Appliance to manage its internal search functionality. Search will crawl only the Learn side of the Marketplace and the Marketplace Gateway page.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">We will use Key Matches to deliver hand-curated content at the top of result pages for the 100 most popular search keywords.</li>
<li dir="ltr">We will use <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/a-visual-guide-to-rich-snippets">Rich Snippets</a> to leverage the power of our structured content internally and externally.</li>
<li dir="ltr">We will offer faceted search, which allows users to filter search results pages to find what they need</li>
<li dir="ltr">We will offer autocomplete, spelling suggestions, and related queries functionality</li>
<li dir="ltr">We will surface not just flat content but videos and infographics in search results.</li>
<li dir="ltr">We will utilize the metric “% Search Exits” in to analyze how many users are exiting the site after they see a search results page. This will allow us to gauge the effectiveness of our internal search results and our results page.</li>
</ul>
