<p><strong>Usage</strong><br>
Iconography is used purposefully throughout healthcare.gov. Iconography should never take center stage in the design. Instead, it should only be used in support of specific pieces of content on the page. Icons should not accompany every piece of content, but rather only important content that could benefit from and be further described by a visual indicator. It is important to achieve a balance with the use of iconography. For example, if every content element on a page has a icon associated with it, it will be nearly impossible to establish a visual hierarchy of information. Additionally, if the content elements on a page are too similar, the icons will not be distinguishable from each other, thereby rendering the visual indicators useless.</p>
<p>The “Learn” side of healthcare.gov specifically uses icons to accompany important pieces of content on the homepage and audience landing pages &mdash; namely content that addresses commonly-asked user questions about the new health care law. Because the icons draw attention to those specific pieces of content, at at glance the user will immediately see that their questions are being addressed, which furthers that sense of trust.</p>
<p>Icons are used extensively in the Marketplace. Because the process of applying for coverage and browsing through eligible plans can at times be complicated and overwhelming, the use of simple iconography allows the user to scan the page for these key visuals to easily find status indicators, primary actions, and functional controls.</p>
<p><strong>Style</strong><br>
The iconography style on healthcare.gov should be simple, bold, and flat. Icons should be a single color or white on a circular color background. Absolutely no drop shadows, gradients, or other special treatments should be used. Soft-edged or rounded-corner icons should be used to lend to the feeling of friendliness and approachability.</p>
<p>While the “Learn” side of healthcare.gov makes use of custom-designed icons, the majority of the Marketplace icons are derived from the Bootstrap glyphicon collection (with a few exceptions that will be later outlined in the design specifications guide).</p>
