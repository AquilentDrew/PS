<p><strong>Photo Usage</strong><br>
Photography is used predominantly on the Learn side on the homepage, the audience landing pages, and the Marketplace Gateway page. Photos are used to support the message on the page, engage the user with identifiable images, and build trust.</p>
<p><strong>Photo Style</strong><br>
The photo on the home page incorporates a soft, out-of-focus background with a sharp foreground image that focuses on the face. This styling connects the user with the person photographed on a more personal level.</p>
<p><img width="1200" height="800" src="../../images/sonya-small.jpg" alt="200364729-001" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2122"></p>
<p>One interesting usability finding is that users focus on faces. People instinctively notice other people. Faces can be used to guide a userâ€™s attention to key content on the page.</p>
<p><strong>Psychology &amp; Emotional Connection</strong><br>
The photography used in this site design is key to making an emotional connection with the user. On the home page, the person in the photograph conveys confidence and ease, promoting a sense of comfort and trust. This is precisely how we want the visitors to healthcare.gov to feel.</p>
