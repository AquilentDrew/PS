<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Appoint Chief Creative Officer (CCO) for healthcare.gov.</strong> This individual should be responsible for ensuring that the visual “brand” of healthcare.gov adheres to quality standards and is carried through consistently across all media platforms (web, print, video, television, marketing, advertising, etc.). This individual is also responsible for ensuring visual continuity between all product lines of healthcare.gov.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Refine and iterate designs on “Learn” side.</strong> The designs contained in this recommendation are intended to provide a strong foundation on which further refinements can be made, additional page designs can be developed, and associated tablet and mobile counterparts can be produced. Ultimately, the CCO will have final approval on all “Learn” designs.</span></span></span></span></li>

<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Refine and iterate designs for Marketplace.</strong> The designs contained in this recommendation should be used as the primary templates for the Marketplace. Additional designs will need to be created to account for additional screens and states of the application, guiding screens, and plan compare interfaces. Ultimately, the CCO will have final approval on all Marketplace designs. To prevent design from being left up to the development team for interpretation, as many screens as necessary (time-permitting) should be designed. Additionally, once development has been completed, the design team should conduct a visual audit of the site to ensure that the designs have been properly implemented.<br>

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Create a high-level style guide for healthcare.gov.</strong> A high-level style guide should be developed that can be used across all media platforms. The recommendations contained in this document can provide a good starting point. This high-level style guide should include quick-reference guidance on the following:</span>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Overview of Guiding Principles</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Visual Values and Tone</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Logo and Logo Usage (with examples of proper and improper usage)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Color Palette (with specific usage examples)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Typography (with specific usage examples)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Imagery (photography, iconography, and illustration with specific usage examples)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Bringing it All Together (concrete examples across major media platforms that show how the values, tone, logo, color, typography, and imagery come together to form specific deliverables)</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The CCO will be responsible for reviewing and approving the high-level style guide.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Create a design specifications guide for each product line of healthcare.gov.</strong> The high-level style guide will not address the specific details of each individual product that makes up healthcare.gov. Accordingly, a design specifications guide must be created for each product. These specification guides will go into great detail about individual design elements such as page layouts and grids, spacing, type treatment, icon treatment, button hierarchy, hover states, form styling, etc. Individual design specifications guides should be created for the following:</span>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Learn side&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Marketplace side</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Guiding screens</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Application</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Enrollment (Plan Select and more)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">My Account</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">SHOP</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Though the individual specification guides will be referenced at a product-level, they will all adhere to the overall healthcare.gov style guidelines and should be experienced as a single, seamless product to the user. Accordingly, the individual specification guides should be created in the same format, be organized in the same way, and be written with the same tone and voice. The CCO will be responsible for reviewing and approving the design specification guides.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Create a design “kit” for various media channels.</strong> To ensure that the healthcare.gov visual “brand” is properly carried out across various media channels, the design team will produce a design asset kit consisting of font files, icon libraries, UI libraries, vector-based illustrations, and raw PSDs in addition to the high-level style guide and appropriate design specification documents. This will ensure that all healthcare.gov contractors and vendors are working from the same files, leaving little room for interpretation. The CCO will be responsible for reviewing and approving the design kits.</span></li></ul></div>
