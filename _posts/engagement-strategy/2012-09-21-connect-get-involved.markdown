<p>We propose a Connect &amp; Get Involved page that for the first time integrates “real-world” and digital engagement efforts: live events, social media, community outreach, the blog, marketing campaigns, individual volunteer opportunities, email efforts, digital opportunities that leverage the power of gamification and incentives, and other efforts.</p>
<p>We will <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/02/09/promote-offline-event/">use social media to promote offline events</a>. And we will use offline events to grow our email list through “pre-enrollment” efforts.</p>
<h3>A New Way to Engage and Connect</h3>
<p>We will incorporate the best features from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/engage">White House’s Engage page</a> and Social Media Hub, and integrate other forms of engagement in a way no other federal agency has done. This “living” page will be updated frequently and evolve constantly. And it will build upon the lessons learned from the existing social media hub on healthcare.gov.</p>
<p>The “Engage” page serves all users, but it will be especially useful for our “champions”&ndash;the fans, supporters, followers on social media, subscribers to our email list, volunteers, partners, and future health care ambassadors that will help us get America covered. We will link offsite to CMS content for partners, Assisters, Navigators and brokers. And we will connect our users with the tools that they need to get involved in person &ndash; not just online.</p>
