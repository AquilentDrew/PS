<p>We will develop digital forms of engagement to build and support partnerships with community leaders, online media, and non-profit organizations. The Secretary and other HHS officials will be holding events in communities across the country. We will <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/02/09/promote-offline-event/">leverage the power of social media</a> to support offline events using the <a href="/engagement-recommendations/connect-get-involved/" title="Connect &amp; Get Involved">Connect &amp; Get Involved page</a>.</p>
<p>Email sign up and account creation will be a priority at offline events before October 1. We will make our online content reusable and sharable. We will develop new ways to empower the uninsured, incentivize volunteers, and work with community leaders to get America covered.</p>
