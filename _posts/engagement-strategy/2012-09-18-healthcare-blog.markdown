<p>We will use the HealthCare Blog to support our engagement and education efforts. The new blog content strategy will be extended across social media, email campaigns, and in-person events across the country.</p>
<p>We see the blog as an ideal platform for the follow-on to the MyCare “real people” campaign. As real Americans get signed up for insurance&ndash;some for the first time, some getting discounts, some in spite of pre-existing conditions&ndash;we can document and share these stories in the blog.</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Educating consumers about current developments in the Marketplace and Affordable Care Act that affect them.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Managing myths and misconceptions about ACA and the Marketplace. We feel this is absolutely critical to us controlling the story about the Marketplace. People will be battered with misinformation. We must counter it with the truth.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Building a sense of momentum for the Countdown to Coverage campaign.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Developing circulation via cross-posting, cross-linking, network promotion, and other techniques. See Linking Strategy</li>
<li dir="ltr">Building SEO rankings for Marketplace content with high-quality, targeted entries that others will link to. Incorporate Google Rich Snippets to improve SEO.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Serving as a hub for Engagement efforts and featuring guest blog posts from “Health Care Ambassadors” from communities across the country.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Serving as a hub for photo and video contests.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Using the blog to build anticipation for upcoming events, hosting live Twitter chats, video town halls, Google Hangouts and other interactive forums.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Serving as an engine of FAQ content creation similar to the “Glad You Asked” feature on the HHS Digital Strategy blog.</li>

<p><strong>Keeping it simple and responsive:</strong> We will set new plain language standards for blog posts, enforce tone of voice, and experiment with authorship and integration with email campaigns.<strong> </strong>We strongly recommend accepting and responding selectively to moderated comments. It’s another way to show we are engaged, listening, and responsive.</p>

<p><strong>Style:&nbsp;</strong>The tone of voice varies a bit from the rest of site content: It is more conversational and casual.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Entries are limited to 200 words.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Entries must abide by our plain language and reading level standards.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Entries must link to content on healthcare.gov and invite additional engagement on social media or provide a specific call to action to encourage enrollment in the Marketplace.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Entries should include images or videos to promote shareability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Authorship: </strong>Instead of “ghost writing” blogs and adding an official’s name to it, we can assign a personality and writing style to each blog author.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of possible author roles and voice:</p>
<p>KGS: High profile announcements, Countdown to Coverage, Milestones (Open Enrollment, Jan 1, 2014, Open Enrollment Closes)<br>
Dori: Testimonials and Real People Stories, Countdown to Coverage<br>
Jason: Data and Infographics, Countdown to Coverage<br>
Mike Hash, Marylyn, Gary Cohen, and Julie B: For Marketplace topics<br>
Bryan Sivak: For the vision/big picture/technology side of HealthCare.gov<br>
Craig Stoltz: For introducing new features and content on the website<br>
Guest blog posts from other HHS and federal stakeholders, experts, community leaders, navigators, testimonials etc.</p>
<p>Blog authors will be leveraged in email outreach communications. We will experiment with email messages that are signed by a person and come from a personal “from address” Ex. Kathleen.Sebelius@HealthCare.gov. We will test to see if these “personalized” messages increase open rate and engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The blog has a prominent place on the functional footer, where the most recent entry and blurb are highlighted, and the next two entries are linked to with their titles.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The blog landing page is linked to from the footer</li>
<li dir="ltr">A snippet featuring the latest entries appears prominently on the<br>
Connect &amp; Get Involved page. This in turn links to the blog home page.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Individual entries appear as related content in right-hand sidebars of &nbsp;Basic Pages along with other similarly tagged content. (Though see “Retirement,” below.) They also appear on related Topics pages</li>
<li dir="ltr">All entries are promoted aggressively via social media (and email outreach as appropriate).</li>
<li dir="ltr">Blog entries show up in site search results &ndash; called out as Blog posts &ndash; and are included in dynamically generated topic pages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Blog entries use the same tags, categories, metadata, and taxonomy as other content items. Every blog item is shareable.</li>
<li dir="ltr">On the blog homepage, tags and categories are displayed for each entry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commenting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Beginning June, the blog accepts moderated comments. This allows the public to feel involved in the process, and represents an important rung on the Ladder of Engagement. (Leaving a blog comment is a “gateway behavior” that can lead to further engagement.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Responses will be written to blog comments to demonstrate that HHS is listening and responding. Periodically, “Glad you asked” entries will batch and answer reader questions and comments.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The<a href="http://newmedia.hhs.gov/standards/comment_policy.html"> HHS Comment Policy</a> will be enforced on the blog.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Retirement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Because some blog content is ephemeral in nature, entries are reviewed every six &nbsp;months for continued relevance. When they are outdated they are archived and will no longer be displayed around the site.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info "><strong>Next Steps</strong><p></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Begin enforcing plain language standards and style requirements</li>
<li dir="ltr">Begin conversations about blog authorship and author voice</li>
<li dir="ltr">Begin the archiving and retirement process on the current version of the HealthCare Blog in preparation for June.</li>
