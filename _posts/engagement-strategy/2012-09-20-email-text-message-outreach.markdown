<p>Our email strategy is one of the most important elements in our relationship with users. Email provides a direct line of communication spanning time, allowing us to inform, engage, drive behavior, and ultimately support them through enrollment and beyond.</p>
<p>Our email goals will change over time:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Through June 1: Sign up users for email updates and personalized content</li>
<li dir="ltr">June 1 &ndash; October 1: Support HealthCare.gov account creation</li>
<li dir="ltr">October 1 &ndash; March 31, 2014: Support account creation, getting users to apply and enroll</li>
<li dir="ltr">October 1, 2014: Re-enrollment</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">General email blasts and announcements (for example, Oct 1 &ndash; The Marketplace is open today). Note: We will not routinely send out news releases. We will retain the ability to push out Featured Updates (News, Blogs, Videos, etc.) if it is consumer-facing and likely to engage users and support the cause of enrollment in the Marketplace.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Asynchronous Campaigns: Ex. A multi-message, carefully-sequenced Welcome campaign; in January 2014, a “Why haven’t you applied?” campaign for those who haven’t</li>
<li dir="ltr">Notifications: During the Application process, we will use the Transactional Message Service to reach out based on events. (for example, You selected your plan, but haven’t enrolled)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Notices &ndash; Official notices of your status. (for example, This is your official Eligibility Determination)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Personalized Content and Email Campaigns</h3>
<p>Email also permits personalized messaging that targets people based on their own expressed needs and interests. Instead of just pushing out the latest content from HealthCare.gov, we will embrace this new approach. For example, once we identify someone as “young and healthy” by virtue of the selections they’ve made on their subscriptions (or via inputs in the Marketplace), we can send an email with links to our “Why Is It Important to Have Health Insurance?” article. By creating asynchronous email campaigns based on users’ profiles and preferences we can increase engagement and provide our users with information that meets their needs.</p>

<p>We will also experiment with sending messages using a personalized “from” address instead of a generic one.</p>
<p><a href="/content-strategy/general-approach/" title="Content Principles">Tone of voice</a> is absolutely critical. Emails must speak with the same friendly, reassuring, empathetic tone that characterizes the rest of the site. The Content team will have a representative on the Email Team, and will produce the text of the emails. Emails must follow the same design principles as the website, to reinforce branding and ensure high quality of visual design.</p>

We will automatically send out a “welcome series” of educational asynchronous messages to new users. The “welcome series” will be refined based on continuous testing and iteration to increase our conversion rate.<p></p>
<p>We will assign audience segments or attributes in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Add a second screen to the signup process and ask questions: “Which best describes you?” and “What &nbsp;are you interested in?”</li>
<li dir="ltr">Send a follow up email to new subscribers and ask questions: “Which best describes you?” and “What &nbsp;are you interested in?”</li>
<li dir="ltr">We can &nbsp;encourage users to sign up for “persona-based” personalized updates from the dynamically generated “persona-based” basic pages.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Getting the most out of existing subscribers and partners</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">We will present current subscribers with opportunities to sign up for other HealthCare.gov topics using three squares or “cards” at the bottom of our email template. We can use these cards to showcase featured content and deepen engagement.</li>
<li dir="ltr">We will align messaging and content strategy for email messages and HealthCare.gov account notifications once they become available.</li>
<li dir="ltr">We can partner with Gov Delivery managers within HHS, Department of Treasury, Department of Labor, the White House, and USA.gov/Gobierno.USA.gov to help spread our most important messages via email.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info "><strong>Next Steps</strong><p></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">To help personalize our messaging, new topics will be created that indirectly capture the key “Persona” groups for the uninsured that we are targeting: 1. Healthy &amp; Young &nbsp;2. Sick, Active, &amp; Worried 3. Passive &amp; Skeptical</li>
<li dir="ltr">Some users will not provide responses that allow us to determine their persona groups. To capture these people as subscribers, we can set up a generic campaign like “The Health Care Law &amp; You” and continue to try to identify the audience segment in subsequent communications.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Develop a separate strategy for text message outreach</li>
<li dir="ltr">Find a better way to segment users up front as they sign up. This is a “Must Have” capability for June 1. We must create a second sign up screen where users can choose from five or fewer featured topics.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Draft a testing plan for personalized “from addresses” in email messages</li></ul></div>
