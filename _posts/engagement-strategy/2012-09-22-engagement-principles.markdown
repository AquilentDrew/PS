<p class="lead">One Strategy. One Effort. One Goal.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Full integration of all outreach efforts, including social media</h3>
<p>In order to get the most value from our efforts, healthcare.gov must be fully integrated into all outreach activities so we can support and enhance them. These include social media channels, email campaigns, public events, volunteer efforts, marketing activities, and more. We cannot afford to think of “the site” as one thing and outreach as another. They are all part of one effort to insure America.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Be Responsive. Support Two-Way Communication</h3>
<p>Healthcare.gov embraces two-way communication as a principle of our engagement with the public. Think “Responsive Government.” We respond to postings on Facebook and Twitter, demonstrating that we are listening and willing to help. We thank people for useful feedback and support. We accept and respond to comments on our blog. We answer user questions in a variety of forums, both digital and analog. We engage with people so they engage with us&ndash;and ultimately enroll in health insurance.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Build Engagement Off-Site and On-Site</h3>
<p>A great deal of our public engagement efforts occur off-site&ndash;via email and text messaging, on social media channels, and at events in communities across the country. But we also elevate and integrate social media in everything that we do. We encourage sharing and participation on healthcare.gov, our social platforms, and in our marketing collateral.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Engagement from Awareness to Enrollment</h3>
<p>Engagement will take different forms at different times. We engage with the public off-site, on social media channels, and at offline events. We engage visitors to healthcare.gov by asking for feedback, signing them up for email updates, and providing personalized content. We encourage them to create a healthcare.gov account. And we are with them every step of the way during the application and enrollment process. </p>
<h3 class="principle">Anticipate, Innovate, and Collaborate</h3>
<p>We will experiment with new social media tools and technology to anticipate the next Twitter, Facebook, or Pinterest. We will come up with innovative new uses for our existing social media platforms. We will collaborate within HHS and with partners across the federal government. And we will work together to analyze and continuously improve our social media program.</p>
