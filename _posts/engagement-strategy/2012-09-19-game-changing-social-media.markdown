<p>We will maintain robust and active Social Media efforts on multiple channels. Social media will serve as an entry point to our ladder of engagement and we will use it strategically to multiply the effectiveness of our outreach efforts. In other words, social media will help us both reach more people and deepen that engagement once we have connected with them.</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Best practice: Don’t just push, engage</li>
<li dir="ltr">Best practice: Get our audience to share content by providing reminders, prompts, incentives, and rewards</li>
<li dir="ltr">Best practice: Experiment constantly with new tools, apps, and social networks</li>
<li dir="ltr">Game-changer: Get audience more involved in process: photo, video, contests, post your own story, rewards for sharing, gamification, etc.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Game-changer: &nbsp;Use social media to identify audience segments and engage using personalized content</li>
<li dir="ltr">Game-changer: Integrate external and social search optimization efforts. Leverage Google+ and <a href="http://blog.ohmygov.com/blogs/general_news/archive/2013/01/23/how-government-can-use-graph-search-to-expand-on-facebook.aspx">Facebook’s powerful new Graph Search</a> functionality</li>
<li dir="ltr">Game-changer: Adopt new tools like <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/25/tech/social-media/twitter-vine/index.html">Twitter’s Vine</a> &ndash; a 6 second mobile video &nbsp;app &ndash; to help our go messages go viral.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Game-changer: Begin targeted sharing and invite user generated content using a<a href="http://napkinlabs.com/tour/"> custom Facebook application</a>. We can target social media outreach geographically and demographically to align with HHS events and marketing efforts. We can run photo and video contests. And we can encourage return visits to our Facebook page and healthcare.gov. A Facebook app also helps us expand our reach with <a href="http://blog.ohmygov.com/blogs/general_news/archive/2013/01/23/how-government-can-use-graph-search-to-expand-on-facebook.aspx">Graph Search</a> and helps us identify audience segments.</li>

<h3>One team for social media</h3>
<p>We will create a unified team with shared resources such as an editorial calendar, overall workflow, analytics reporting process, and a strategy for future social media channels.</p>

We have a mix of staff who manage our social media accounts. For many of them, social media is not their primary area of responsibility and the quality of our user experience suffered as a result. For the new healthcare.gov, we need dedicated community managers along with additional content staff to run our social media channels.<p></p>
<p><strong>Unified Editorial Calendar:</strong> The Social Media Team will produce an editorial calendar and leverage tools like HootSuite and Measured Voice to schedule and post content to our social media channels. These tools will also allow for a review and approval process to ensure consistent messaging.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics Reporting:</strong> The Social Media team will also use tools like Chartbeat, Radian6, and other tools to assess the effectiveness of their efforts and improve performance on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Current Social Media Channels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/HealthCareGov">HealthCare.gov Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Healthcare.gov">HealthCare.gov Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/HealthCareGov">HealthCare.gov YouTube</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/MarketplaceGov">Marketplace Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/HealthInsuranceMarketplace">Marketplace Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/HHSGov">HHS.gov Twitter</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Future Social Media Channels: </strong>Before creating an additional social media channel, we need to weigh the costs and benefits of making it a HealthCare.gov channel or a Marketplace channel. For the June relaunch, we need to assess the value of having two sets of social media channels &ndash; one for HealthCare.gov and one for the Health Insurance Marketplace. Splitting the audiences may turn out to hurt more than help us. Data should drive the decision.</p>
<p>Here is a list of potential channels under consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/about/">Pinterest</a>: Women &ndash; potential for viral content</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/about">Tumblr</a>: Young Adults &ndash; potential for viral content</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/+/learnmore/">Google+</a>: Boosts SEO and lets us<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/01/24/watch-fireside-hangout-vice-president-biden-reducing-gun-violence"> host and record live events using “Hangout” feature</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/home?trk=hb_home">LinkedIn</a>: Small Business &amp; Self Employed</li>
<li><a href="https://new.myspace.com/">New Myspace</a>: Young Adults, artists, designers, musicians, “Healthy &amp; Young” etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://storify.com/">Storify</a>: Replicates the Social Hub experience without all of the back end development work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comments Policy:</strong> The<a href="http://newmedia.hhs.gov/standards/comment_policy.html"> HHS Comments policy</a> will be enforced on all social media channels. Community managers will be empowered to ban repeat offenders who post spam or otherwise violate the policy. All views are welcome but disruptive behavior that violates the comments policy and ruins the conversation for others will not be tolerated.</p>
<p><strong>Social Hub:</strong> The current Social Hub concept will be incorporated into the new Engage page. Between now and June 1, different layouts, approaches, and calls to action will be tested and optimized.</p>
