<p class="lead">From the three big ideas, we developed seven guiding principles that inform decisions throughout HealthCare.gov. These principles are supplemented by others specific to certain areas. These are <a href="http://hcgovswat.edmullen.com/tag/principles-2/">spread throughout</a> this website.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Full integration of outreach plans, including social media</h3>
<p>In order to get maximum value from outreach efforts, healthcare.gov must be fully integrated into all outreach activities so we can support and enhance them. These include social media channels, email campaigns, public events, volunteer efforts, marketing activities, and so on. We cannot afford to think of “the site” as one thing and outreach as another. They are all part of a united effort to insure America.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Serve everybody</h3>
<p>By “everybody” we mean people who speak only Spanish and adults who have not graduated high school. The young and healthy and the sick and worried. Users of desktop computers and those who have web-enabled smart phones. Social media power users and people with only a land-line telephone. The blind, the deaf, and the disabled. While our marketing and outreach will target certain communities and demographics, our education and enrollment process must support everybody. We have developed strategies to ensure we serve all of the uninsured.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Strict consumer orientation</h3>
<p>In order to support a laser focus on enrolling the uninsured, only consumer-facing content &nbsp;appears on healthcare.gov. We have developed a strategy to ensure that non-consumer stakeholders&ndash;such as partners, states, media, and HHS employees&ndash;get the information about the Affordable Care Act that they need. For more on this, see the <a href="http://hcgovswat.edmullen.com/content-strategy/" title="Content Strategy">Content Strategy.</a></p>
<h3 class="principle">Friction-free information architecture and user experience</h3>
<p>Learning about and enrolling in health insurance is hard. We must do everything we can to ensure users are not frustrated or confused. Our simple, plain language will contribute to this. So will our use of flexible, shared content, which will allow us to quickly adapt to user needs without disrupting user experience. And we have designed the site to support user-directed navigation, personalized experience, and clear next steps. We will act as “<a href="http://hcgovswat.edmullen.com/experience-information-architecture/shepherding-people-through-the-process/" title="Shepherding People Through the Process">shepherds</a>” to ensure Marketplace users get from Point A to Point Z, trusting that we will provide help when they need it but not interfere when they don’t.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Support for the Digital Government Strategy</h3>
<p>From our open-source technology solutions, to our use of shared services, to our approach to content-as-data, to our use of a shared platform, to our use of plain language and metrics, we embrace the practices set forth in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/digitalgov/about">Digital Government Strategy</a>. We will set a high bar for others to aim for.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Test everything and improve continually</h3>
<p>Healthcare.gov is operated on the principle of “test everything and change as needed.” In order to provide our users with the best possible experience we must be dedicated to understanding how they are using the site and adjusting the functionality and messaging to improve their experience. We A/B test images, content, and features whenever there is a question regarding performance. We embrace metrics-driven decisions and constant iteration to ensure we are achieving our goals. In many ways our own journey to ensure we are accomplishing our mission begins rather than ends on October 1.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Sonya rules</h3>
<p>Whenever we make a decision, we think about Sonya and what she needs in order to get good health insurance. If we keep doing that, we can’t go too far wrong.</p>
