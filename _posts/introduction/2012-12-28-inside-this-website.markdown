<p>This website documents the approach we will be taking to establish a cohesive, effective experience for our audience in service to our goal of insuring the uninsured. It is the culmination not of two weeks effort by a handful of people, but of the work done by many people over many months up to this point, including lessons-learned from three years operating healthcare.gov, work done specifically as part of the Marketplace effort, and guidance and insight provided by external efforts such as Enroll UX 2014.</p>

<p><em>This document will continue to grow and evolve as more detail and nuance gets added through and beyond launch.</em></p>

Before we can engage the user, build trust, and ultimately convert the uninsured into the insured, we must understand who our audience is, identify and demonstrate empathy for their concerns, and work to eliminate the obstacles in the way of their getting health insurance.</p>

Content on healthcare.gov is designed to educate, engage, and drive users to enrollment. Our content will serve all users, work well on all platforms, and help the uninsured understand their obligations, opportunities, and processes for getting health insurance.</p>

Engaging our users is essential to our goal of converting the uninsured. The time from first awareness to enrollment will likely be weeks or months. We must engage them throughout this period to educate them, build a relationship of trust, support their decision-making, and facilitate their enrollment through a single, unified approach to engagement.</p>

The overall visual design direction for healthcare.gov can be summed up in one word &ndash; TRUST.
