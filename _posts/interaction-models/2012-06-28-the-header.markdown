<p>Healthcare.gov has two major experiences. The “Learn” experience is a mostly self-guided educational experience that meets the needs of users lower down on the Ladder of Engagement; people who are trying to understand their rights, options, and benefits. The Marketplace is a largely self-guided experience, customized based on information the user inputs, with open- and special-enrollment periods during which people can apply.</p>
<p>Both experiences utilize consistent header navigation, allowing the user to move between the two, with visibile indication of which experience she is currently in.</p>

<p>The header treatments establish a familiar pattern, but allow for variation to meet the needs of each experience. Global navigation allows the user to toggle between the Learn experience and the Marketplace. Global features such as the healthcare.gov user accounts, notifications, and Spanish/English selections are available in both experiences. The Learn Local Utility Band allows for content navigation, while the Marketplace band provides context and help.</p>

<p>As the user scrolls, the local navigation band attaches to the top of the browser, providing the user with navigation options, context, or access to search or help.</p>
