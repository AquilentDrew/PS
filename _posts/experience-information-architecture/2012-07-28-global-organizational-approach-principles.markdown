<p class="lead">Healthcare.gov is a platform for converting uninsured Americans into insured ones. The organization of information, flows, and actions must be focused on effectuating this goal. Toward this end, the following global organizing principles inform and guide the experience and information architecture.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Facilitate the Ladder of Engagement</h3>
<p>We know that our audience will go through a number of phases as they sort through their obligations, understanding, options, and decisions. The Ladder of Engagement outlines the various stages a person will go through in their journey to enrolling through the Marketplace. At each rung of this ladder, people will need different but equally meaningful experiences to get to the point of enrollment. Our architecture is built to meet the needs at each rung and offer easy steps up to the next rung.</p>

<a id="experience-offsite"></a></p>
<h3 class="principle">The user’s experience starts off-site.</h3>
<p>Defining an information architecture that begins and ends at the edges of our website is defining an artificial reality. Each rung of our Ladder of Engagement requires significant off-site activity and coordination to make our on-site activities successful.		</p><div id="TbsCollapseId-1881257354" class="accordion ">

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Awareness:</strong> Either through our own efforts, those of our partners, or atmospheric chatter, our audience will become aware that changes will affect them and will begin on their journey towards coverage.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Education:</strong> Once they are aware that changes may affect them, most people will begin their educational journey through Google. Our content needs to be optimized to be the best resources for people seeking answers related to becoming insured.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Engagement:</strong> As we learn about individuals who are seeking information, and once they have created an account, we can tailor [asynchronous email campaigns] that draw on our understanding of their psychographic segments, anticipating their needs, and helping to “turn them out” to act.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Enroll:</strong> Our application process is long and complex. We need to be able to provide personalized notifications (email and/or SMS) to remind users of progress and next steps and nudge them back into action.</span></li>

<h3 class="principle">We can’t plan all user pathways.</h3>
<p>People will enter and move around in our system in a variety of ways. While it is helpful to develop scenarios and flows for our internal purposes, we need to recognize that they only go so far. To the greatest extent possible, we need to allow people to move around our system and come and go as they see fit, particularly in our public spaces.</p>
<p>We must:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Plan for non-linear interactivity</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Engage and return users when off-site</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Accommodate happy returns</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="principle">Help people find the answers they need</h3>
<p>The changes that the law brings are significant and affect many people. Change always leads to uncertainty. A primary task for HealthCare.gov is to answer the questions people have. In order to do this, we must understand the questions people have, and deliver content in ways that gets the answers to people as quickly and effectively as possible. We have structured HealthCare.gov to meet these needs. We have based our current approach on existing HHS research of the user needs. We’ll continue to reassess these needs on an ongoing basis to ensure our structures reflect our findings and data.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Help people take the actions they need to take</h3>
<p>We recognize that for many people, the process of applying and enrolling in plans through the Marketplace will be very complex regardless of our efforts, due to the complexity of the business rules and policy. Yet we cannot pass along the burden of understanding this complex process to the user. Instead, we are adopting a “never lost” approach called (“Shepherding”). As people move through the process, we are not overly concerned with explaining every step of where they have been and where they will go, but rather always present clear next steps and reduced noise.</p>
<h3 class="principle">Adapt our structures as needed</h3>
<p>Defining a permanent organizational structure for a website, especially a large website, can be a perilous exercise. We can presume to understand our users well. We can presume to understand we know all the content needs our site will be required to meet over time. Yet in reality, we are making our best guess, even when backed by research. The implications of incorrect assumptions can be significant. We can complicate our users’ experience. We can enshrine our decisions in external search engines. We can make reorganization very difficult and expensive.</p>
<p>We have made a number of decisions to mitigate this risk.</p>
