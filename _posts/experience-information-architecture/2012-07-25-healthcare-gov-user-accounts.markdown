<p>Across our operations, there is a need to connect with our audience in meaningful ways. Off-site we want to communicate with them in ways they will appreciate and respond to. We also want to be able to draw them back to the site at meaningful intervals. On-site, we want to be able to offer people meaningful recommendations based on their segment and interests. And of course, in order to apply, people will need to submit a lot of personal information to complete enrollment. For these reasons and others, we will need people to be able to create HealthCare.gov user accounts.</p>
<p>The burden of creating an account must be minimal, as the payoff for users will have a low perceived value early on. They may simply be signing up for email, registering at an event, or signing up under the frame of “pre-enrollment.” Over time, the accounts will be used for different aspects of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="/engagement-recommendations/">engagement</a>&nbsp;and <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">content personalization.</span> Email and text notifications will be a subset of the account functionality. Once the Marketplace opens, this account will be the base upon which we add additional personal information and eventual identity proofing.</p>
<p>The user experience for the account must be considered in decision-making around what accounts are and how they work.</p>
<p><strong>The following diagram defines methods of account creation.</strong></p>
