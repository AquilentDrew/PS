<p>On the Learn side of the site, we are proposing a dramatic departure from our past. Not because it’s novel, but because we think it’s right for our audience. The new “Learn” side will be flatter, simplified, and more adaptable than its predecessor. We have learned a lot over the last three years and need to build on that knowledge. We need to continue to learn and grow. And we need to continue to help our audience learn and grow and move through a challenging set of hurdles.</p>
<h3>Three big themes run through the architecture of the Learn experience:</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/experience-information-architecture/favor-most-needed-content/" title="Favor Most Needed Content">1. Favor the most needed content</a>&nbsp;</strong>- Based on data and research, get the most critical information into the hands of our users quickly.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/experience-information-architecture/flat-architecture/" title="Flat Architecture">2. Flatten our hierarchies</a></strong>&nbsp;- Reduce the number of steps people need to go through to get what they need, while building a system that is easily adaptable to change.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/experience-information-architecture/structure-our-content/" title="Structure Our Content">3. Structure our content</a></strong>&nbsp;- Think of content as data to make it findable, reusable and adaptable.</p>
