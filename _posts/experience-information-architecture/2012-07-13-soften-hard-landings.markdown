<p>There will be many scenarios where people find that the Marketplace has no options for them due to circumstances such as states choosing not to expand Medicaid. In these situations, we must offer potential next steps for finding care options.</p>
<p>When the system determines the user is ineligible for anything in the Marketplace, we should clearly express this outcome, but present the user with a link to find other options. These other options would be communicated on a page in the Learning side of the site. The exact content is TBD, but could be delivered a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Basic content pages written to include options such as Community Health Centers, etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Send users to a dynamically-built topic page listing content items tagged “ineligible.”</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Utilize outside APIs from partners such as HRSA or others that may exist to catalog options.</span></li>
</ul>

</strong>Work with subject matter experts to identify what options are relevant to ineligible applicants and determine how best to present those options.</div></div>
