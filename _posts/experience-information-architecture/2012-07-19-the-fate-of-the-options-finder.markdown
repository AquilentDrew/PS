<p>The Existing HealthCare.gov Options Finder was created to allow the user to enter a handful of quick, non-personally identifiable pieces of information in order to surface coverage options that match their needs. The keystone was the Plan Finder component that displayed available private insurance options.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons, we feel that the cost and potential confusion of rebuilding the Finder for HealthCare.gov outweighs the potential benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Once the Marketplace is open, the value of non-Qualified Health Plans is greatly reduced. These plans do not deliver comparable protection or value and we no longer are motivated to encourage people to buy them.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The API should live on, however.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Several of our new content types </span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">will include interactive components which will deliver information based on a user’s state or other information inputs.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Our general, data-driven organizational scheme will decrease the number of content items and increase the ease with which a user will find them.</span></li>
</ul>
