<p>Upon review of existing HealthCare.gov content and traffic behavior, and while thinking forward about future content, we recognize that we must deliver our content in better ways. We must understand our audience’s <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">information needs</span>, recognize the way they find, use, and navigate our content and site. The more rapidly we meet their needs, the more rapidly we earn their trust.</p>
<p>One clear realization we came to is that<strong> a relative handful of pages account for the bulk of all traffic.</strong> Currently, the most heavily trafficked fifteen pages account for about 48% of all traffic. Yet this content is not as immediately findable, browsable, or optimized as it should be.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/top-15-trafficked-pages.jpg"><img width="1600" height="727" src="../../images/top-15-trafficked-pages.jpg" alt="top-15-trafficked-pages" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1020"></a></p>
<p>These numbers reflect HealthCare.gov content after the January relaunch and factor in some anticipated content mergers. For example, traffic currently spread across many different state-by-state “Information for You” pages is combined based on current planning. Given users’ forthcoming needs for Marketplace information, we expect this pattern of a relatively small number of pages accounting for around half the content to continue and even accelerate.</p>
<p><strong>Conversely, HealthCare.gov includes hundreds of pages with very little traffic.</strong> The 61st most trafficked page receives about .16% of all traffic. In some cases, that means content is unnecessary. In other cases, it means that the content is very focused on meeting a niche need.</p>
<p>Yet in the past, we have largely treated popular pages and rarely accessed content the same way. We have build it into a hierarchical content tree that doesn’t serve either extreme very well.</p>
