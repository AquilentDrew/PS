<p>Starting in October, Healthcare.gov must efficiently drive users who live in states with their own Marketplaces (“state users”) to those Marketplaces. This is as critical a task as moving users who live in other states into the FFE Marketplace.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Our approach to state Marketplaces evolves from June launch until open enrollment.</span></p>
<h3><b><b></b></b>June Strategy</h3>
<p>June through September, we do not want to send users immediately to their Marketplace state pages. Two reasons: &nbsp;<b><b><br>
</b></b></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">First, we would &nbsp;miss the opportunity to educate them about the Marketplace in general and engage them in the months-long pre-enrollment process.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Second, state websites are very much works in progress at this point, where people will not be able to take action. The quality of the sites’ educational materials is likely to be uneven.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having said that, in all places where Marketplace links are located around healthcare.gov, we will always feature a prominent link to “Learn about the Marketplace in your state.”<b id="internal-source-marker_0.09622949082404375"></b></p>
<p>This page will include a very small amount of explanatory information about the relationship between the state and the federal government.</p>
<p>It will then present a state drop-down menu. Users whose states we’ve already learned, via geolocation or inputs elsewhere, will have their state preselected but they change states via the drop-down.</p>
<p>When the user chooses their state, a single paragraph will appear below the dropdown that explains whether their state operates a Marketplace or whether they will use the federal Marketplace. A single link will send them either to their state’s Marketplace website or to the federal Marketplace Gateway page.<br>
When users set up a Marketplace account (when that feature becomes available), they are first prompted to enter their state. They will get a page similar to the one above. We will explain that they may still set up a Marketplace account to get emails.</p>
<h3><b id="internal-source-marker_0.09622949082404375"></b>September Strategy</h3>
<p>We begin to send state users more aggressively to their state Marketplace pages, where educational content will be better and pre-enrollment actions may be available. We will do this via prominent links on both the Marketplace Gateway page and the Learn home page. Links will be marked with a badge that says “Read this first.”</p>
<h3>October and Beyond</h3>
<p>We make the state exchange links even more prominent. When users begin the process of creating accounts, the first question is what state they live in. When they choose a Marketplace state, they will see a card that explains that they will be sent to their state’s Marketplace website and provides a direct link.</p>
<h3>State Information and IA</h3>
<p>All pages with state information will be meta-tagged with the state’s name. A user can therefore click on a tag at any time and see all content related to that state, such as blogs, Medicaid information, individual state pages we create for other reasons, and so on. These tags will appear on the bottom of all state-related information. They will also appear on right-hand sidebars once we identify a user’s state.</p>
