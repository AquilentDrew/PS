<h3>Learn Side</h3>
<p>The Learn side of HealthCare.gov (and the Marketplace landing page) will be built using fully responsive design techniques. We will maintain a single codebase and set of content that is used across devices. This method is appropriate to the kind of content we are delivering in this area and reduces the amount of maintenance of separate instances.</p>

<h3>Marketplace Side</h3>
<p>Given the complexity of the Marketplace process, building a fully responsive website is not advisable, nor is it probably possible. However, the value of allowing people to access the site via mobile device is undeniable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many people are mobile-only. This is especially true with Spanish speakers. We don’t know what percentage of our audience would fall into this category, but given the demographics, it is likely a sizable number. For mobile-only people, a “supplemental” mobile experience isn’t helpful.</li>
<li>We will adopt some light responsive techniques to improve the viewing of certain pages of the Marketplace on large tablets and big monitors.</li>
<li>At this point, we are recommending a separate mobile-optimized website that is streamlined but which delivers the ability to complete the full process. Not allowing for full completion with disadvantage those who use the internet exclusively via mobile.</li>
<li>People must be able to stop working on one device and pick up on another based on where they are in the process after they log in.</li>
<li>People must be able to move between the responsive Learn side of the site and the mobile-optimized without too much discordance.</li>
</ul>
