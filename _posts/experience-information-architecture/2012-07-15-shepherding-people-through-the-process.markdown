<p>We recognize that the Marketplace application process for many people will be long. We face a number of challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Many of the uninsured have very little familiarity with insurance and how it works.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Business and policy rules make the experience an operation of exceptions. There are few shared pathways. Each person will have a somewhat different experience depending on their family and income situations.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">There aren’t really any comparable experiences people can draw from to help them prepare for or fully understand the process. As much as we’d like to reference an e-commerce experience, or filing taxes, or booking a flight&ndash;or even commercial online insurance sites&ndash;these analogies fall apart pretty quickly. The Marketplace experience is inherently more complex.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Policy continues to be in flux, as well as realities on the ground, such a states choosing whether to expand Medicaid.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This has led us to the conclusion that attempting to articulate the full process to users and communicate to them where they are is probably not only impossible, but unhelpful regardless. More meaningful is making sure that our users never feel lost and always know their next step. This idea is known as “shepherding.” It is woven throughout the Marketplace experience. Reducing noise, making the next step clear. Relieving cognitive load where we can.</p>
<p>There are also larger architectural manifestations of the shepherding idea&ndash;pages and processes created exclusively for the purpose of helping people move through a complex system.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Notifications &ndash; People will move in and out of the process numerous times before they are done. Pulling them back into the system at the right times will be very important to ensuring success.</span></p>

<h3>Many happy returns</h3>
<p>Given that people will move in and out of the process, making sure that each return leads smoothly to the right place and the next action is critical. The way this will happen is through a strategy that directs people to different places upon signing into the system depending on where they are in the enrollment process. Once a person signs in, she is greeted with one of several possible welcoming screens designed to contextualize where she is and provide a quick, uncluttered route right back into action.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the experiences people get depending on their place in the process.</p>
