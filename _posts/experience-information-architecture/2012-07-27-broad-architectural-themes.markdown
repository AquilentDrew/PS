			<p>At different points in the Ladder of Engagement, people will have very different needs that require different experiences. But these experiences must be carefully coordinated to ensure a harmonious experience.</p>
<p>In terms of the platform we need to build, there are three major aspects to our architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/experience-information-architecture/learn-side/" title="Learn Side &amp; Sitemap"><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">“Learn” experience</strong></a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> &ndash; The Learn side is fully public and focused on addressing the information needs of all people, year-round. To a significant extent, this area is of primary use during the education and engagement phases, though the content will be continuously useful. It is a largely self-guided experience. This is enhanced via our personalized related content recommendations.</span></li>
<li><a href="/experience-information-architecture/general-marketplace-architecture-2/" title="General Marketplace Architecture"><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Marketplace experience</strong></a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> &ndash; The Marketplace is focused on taking action to get coverage, primarily during Open Enrollment and in the Enrollment phase of our Ladder of Engagement. There are some open aspects, but much of the functionality of applying and enrolling happens only after creating an account. This is a largely guided experience, but accommodates some exploration.</span></li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Engagement experience</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> &ndash; Our engagement effort is the glue that binds our total experience together. Our engagement will bring people in, allow us to deliver meaningful content, build trust, communicate off-site, bring people back, and help them along their journey to enrollment. The <a target="_blank" href="/engagement-recommendations/">Engagement Strategy</a>&nbsp;outlines these efforts. Engagement is mentioned here because is must be thought of as part of the experience architecture we are building. It cannot be separate or isolated.</span></li>
<li><a href="/experience-information-architecture/healthcare-gov-user-accounts/" title="Healthcare.gov User Accounts"><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">HealthCare.gov Accounts</strong></a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> &ndash; Many pre-enrollment and engagement interactions, as well as the application process, are dependent on a user account that allows for low-stakes entry with little commitment and gradually builds, in most cases, to identity proofing and enrollment. By connecting us to individuals, we are able to accompany our audience on their journey up the Ladder of Engagement to enrollment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>While healthcare.gov is a single property, it makes sense that we allow differing needs to determine different architectures in different places.</p>
