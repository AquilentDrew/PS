<p>We are embracing the concept of “Content as Data”. We will heavily structure our content and tag it&nbsp; with metadata for re-use, syndication, and selective deployment around the site, and potentially beyond later on.</p>
<p>Structured content is crucial to both the user and the creators of the site. The user experience is easier browsing, more efficient searching, and more dynamic and personalized movement through the site.</p>
<p>With proper content structure, site creators are better able to customize content based on use. Work is streamlined, efficient, and less prone to error as changes made to content in one area of the site automatically carry over to all applicable areas.</p>
<p>For most content there will be a Master Content File in the CMS, in which all elements of the content live. This master file will be excerpted, displayed, mashed up, or used whole depending on what we want to deliver to users in a given situation. This will require each content item to be rich with metadata that will align strictly with site taxonomy.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info "><strong>Next Steps</strong><p></p>
<p><strong></strong>Continue to flesh out additional needs and specific requirements to make our content as meaningful as possible as data.</p></div>
<h3>Taxonomy</h3>
<p>We will use tags and metadata to find, use, and share content throughout the Learn and Marketplace parts of the site. Extensive work has already been done to define a taxonomy for HealthCare.gov, and we largely endorse this work.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info "><strong>Next Steps</strong><p></p>
<ul>
<li>Content team to work with Taxonomy team to help them understand the categories of content available in Healthcare.gov and allow them to adapt and upgrade current taxonomy to create a robust, final taxonomy that will achieve our desired goal of an intuitive, flexible site.</li>
<li>Review taxonomy with all appropriate parties&nbsp;(including business, technical, and content/SEO) and revise as needed.</li>
<li>Incorporate taxonomy strategy into site search, content management, eligibility, and enrollment applications, user help, and support.</li></ul></div>
