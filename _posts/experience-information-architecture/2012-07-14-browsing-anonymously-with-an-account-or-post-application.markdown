<p>It is reasonable to assume that people shopping online prefer to review items for which they are shopping prior to any lengthy process they might need to complete before purchase. This sort of research is common when shopping for cars, homes, mortgages, or even health insurance from other private websites.</p>
<p>For the Marketplace, this assumption is hard to assess. Plan availability and reduced pricing can be dramatically different after completing the Individual Application than those shown during anonymous browsing. The risk of sticker shock or disappointment over unavailable plans or ineligibility complicate this situation.</p>
<h4>Allowing for varied pathways, adaptable to lessons learned</h4>
<p>In order to handle this uncertainty, we will plan for both pathways, trying to make each experience the best it can be. Once we have real people using the site, the appropriate product managers will track and monitor the conversion rate of each pathway. If users who begin shopping anonymously end up completing enrollment at a higher rate than those who start with the application, we can modify our gateway page to favor that pathway. If the inverse is true, we can make changes accordingly. It is unlikely that we will be able to truly test these two scenarios accurately until we have the whole process in place. Luckily, if both pathways exist, we can test and modify the entry into each pathway primarily through simple front-end design changes.</p>
<h4>Easy steps up</h4>
<p>For those who pursue an anonymous browsing experience, we should allow for their exploration while providing easy steps up to creating an account. An account will allow them to save and compare plans they like. And when they are ready, we need to have additional easy steps up for starting and completing an application. Once their eligibility has been determined, we need to transition their saved or selected plans if they are still available to them.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em>&nbsp;Whenever we present plans in an anonymous browsing experience, the messaging must be very clear that the plans may ultimately be unavailable and any cost reductions users qualify for are not reflected in the displayed prices. We also need to explain that the only way they can learn what they individually qualify for and will pay is to complete the insurance application process.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the anonymous browsing experience and its steps up to browsing with an account. Both experiences show actiosn that would guide a person into submitting an application.</p>
