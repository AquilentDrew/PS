<p>We have built an extremely flat architecture in order to make content discovery very quick. This structure allows us to organize content freely, test and learn how well we are meeting user needs, and adjust on the fly without major architectural dependencies. Our approach centers around three ideas:</p>
<h3>Browse, Search, Iterate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Browse</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> -&nbsp; Ensure the most-needed content is extremely easy to browse to, and hard to miss. We will do this through **curation**, making very intentional choices about which few items are featured where, and by *personalization**, recommending content to users based on our understanding of their needs, interests, and particular situations.</span></li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Search</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> &ndash; Create a search experience that makes less-popular content easy to get to.</span></li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Iterate</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> &ndash; Monitor usage constantly, test, and reorganize content as necessary. (Our structures allow for rapid change and do not enshrine our organizational schemes.)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Designed for Change</h3>
<p>All of our content structures are flexible, and intentionally designed to allow for rapid change based on growing evidence as we continue to learn more and more about our users. We will not be locked into the assumptions we make at launch.</p>
<h3>Main Sections</h3>
<p><strong>“Individuals &amp; Families” and “Small Business” landing pages<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Two main pages feature curated collections of the most meaningful and requested content as determined by editors reflecting user needs.</p>
<p><strong>”All Topics” section</strong></p>
<p>The All topics section is the repository for all evergreen content on the website. This is a single “flat file” that intentionally does not impose any architecture preconceived notions on the content.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The All Topics landing page contains groupings of pages based on topic. These are curated groups that help ease discovery. However, they do not reflect a permanent hierarchical page structure, nor are these groups represented in the URL string. As editors’ understanding of peoples’ needs evolve, these groups can be reconfigured as needed without extensive, costly architectural re-engineering or damaging SEO page rank by shifting URLS.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Content items are standalone pages which are accessed either through browsing or search. They are stripped of distracting page furniture to focus on content, but are enhanced with metadata and personalized recommendations that allow people to move from the page onto other meaningful content. It was our goal to make the content as consumable and direct as possible, while still creating friction-free movement onto other meaningful content.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>”Search Results” page</strong></p>
<p>Search is integral to our information architecture. While browsing is a smart choice for our most needed pages, search is better for others. Sometimes in an attempt to find a place for outliers, we can create overly abstract and non-specific groupings that impede discovery of common content.</p>
