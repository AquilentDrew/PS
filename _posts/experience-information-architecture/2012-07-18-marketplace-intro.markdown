<p>The Marketplace is an extremely complex experience, and will remain complex despite our best efforts. Whereas in the Learn side of the site we have been able to opt for simplicity of experience, this is much more difficult in the Marketplace. In this case, we must strive to hide complexity and adopt tactics that make the length and other challenges manageable.</p>
<p>The general architecture has been developed in order to accommodate complex business needs while embracing a person-centric approach whenever possible and appropriate. It has incorporated many good ideas and techniques initially recommended in IDEOâ€™s EnrollUX 2014 work. (The EnrollUX 2014 continues to be strong reference material for ongoing decision-making).</p>
<h3>Architectural flows are defined for:</h3>
<p><strong>1. <a href="/experience-information-architecture/general-marketplace-architecture-2/" title="General Marketplace Architecture">General Marketplace Architecture</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="/experience-information-architecture/individual-pathway-2/" title="Individual Pathway">Individual Pathway</a></strong></p>
<h3>Additionally, three key ideas are explored in depth:</h3>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1. <a href="/experience-information-architecture/shepherding-people-through-the-process/" title="Shepherding People Through the Process">Shepherd people through the process</a></strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> &ndash; With such a complex process, we will focus on making sure people always understand their next step forward.</span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2. <a href="/experience-information-architecture/browsing-anonymously-with-an-account-or-post-application/" title="Browsing Anonymously, with an Account, or Post-Application">Browsing Anonymously, with an Account, or Post-Application</a></strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> &ndash; We must plan for different pathways to enrollment, track success, and adapt to favor more successful pathways.</span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">3. <a href="/experience-information-architecture/soften-hard-landings/" title="Soften Hard Landings">Soften hard landings</a></strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> &ndash; Many people will not have positive outcomes from the Marketplace. For those people we must provide some path forward.</span></p>
