<p class="lead">If users are to trust us, we must provide help when they need it. This is also a key part of creating a friction-free experience. Our goal is to provide help content so thorough and contextual that few users need to access the more expensive forms of help such as phone, chat, and navigators.</p>
<p class="lead">We recommend a robust contexual help process on the Marketplace side, and a Help Center approach on the Learn side.</p>
